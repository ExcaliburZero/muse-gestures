# Muse Gestures
Muse Gestures is a Java library used for recognizing specific gestures using a Muse headband. It includes an interface and server class which allow you to create classes which will automatically have certain methods called when gestures are performed.

```
public class MuseCar implements MuseGestures {

	public MuseCar() {
		int port = 5000;
		MuseGestureServer server = new MuseGestureServer(this, port);
		server.start();
	}

	public void onBlink() {
		System.out.println("Flash lights!")
	}

	public void onJawClench() {
		this.goForward();
	}

}
```

For a complete list of the recognized gestures, see the documentation on [MuseGesture](https://excaliburzero.github.io/muse-gestures/musegestures/MuseGesture.html).
